Created a NodeJS application with basic CRUD API services for users. Postman was used for testing the APIs, allowing for various types of requests like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH, and inspecting responses easily. MySQL Workbench was used as the database to store entries.

Prometheus Metrics: Files named cpu_alerts, memory_alerts, and targets are YAML files used for collecting metrics of the NodeJS application. These files were configured in the Prometheus root directory so that Prometheus could easily track them to collect metrics of our application.
